This repository contains majority of my projects during studying Computer Science at [Faculty of Fundamental Problems of Technology](http://wppt.pwr.edu.pl/en/) in [Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology](http://pwr.edu.pl/en/).</br>
Codes are from different parts of studying, from fresh-year 2018 till today, so the coding style may (and will) change.</br></br>

Below are links to projects I took part in, but are hosted somewhere else:
* [GO Game (Java)](https://github.com/Skazmen/ProjektTP)
* [Twitter generator (Python)](https://github.com/Reclocco/PYTON-SUPER-PROJEKT)
