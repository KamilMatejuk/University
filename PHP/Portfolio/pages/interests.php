'Strong' AI is usually labelled as <em>Artificial General Intelligence</em>, while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called <em>Artificial Biological Intelligence</em>. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of intelligent agents: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.";

A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines). A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically. Graphs are one of the principal objects of study in discrete mathematics.";
