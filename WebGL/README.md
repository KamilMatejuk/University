## Topics
### Koch_Snowflake
Draw a 2D fractal of [Koch Snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake) of degree specified by user.
First program uses simple `SVG`, second one `WebGL`.

### Sierpinsky_Triangle
Draw a 2D fractal of [Sierpinsky Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle) of degree specified by user.
First program uses simple `SVG`, second one `WebGL`.

### Maze
Implement simple camera movement (without rotation), and generate random cuboids on the path to avoid.

### Turtle 1
Implement procedure of *Turtle Graphics*, also known as [Logo programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)). Using commands `forward`, `left` and `right`, draw some shapes in different colours.

### Turtle 2
Implement procedure of *Turtle Graphics*, also known as [Logo programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)). Get coanvas scaled boundries form user, as well as drawing color. Give user option to input commands (`forward`, `left`, `right`) to draw path in specified color.

### Turtle 3D
Implement procedure of *Turtle Graphics*, also known as [Logo programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)). Now the user can move in 3 dimentions, using commands `forward`, `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`.
