        <h2>Standard Model</h2>
        <section>
            <p>
                The Standard Model of particle physics is the theory describing three of the four known fundamental
                forces (the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, and not including gravity) in the universe,
                as well as classifying all known elementary particles. It was developed in stages throughout the latter
                half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists around the world,[1] with the current
                formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks.
                Since then, confirmation of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012)
                have added further credence to the Standard Model. In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various
                properties of weak neutral currents and the W and Z bosons with great accuracy.

            <h4>Construction of the Standard Model Lagrangian</h4>
            <p>
                Technically, quantum field theory provides the mathematical framework for the Standard Model, in which a
                Lagrangian controls the dynamics and kinematics of the theory. Each kind of particle is described in
                terms of a dynamical field that pervades space-time. The construction of the Standard Model proceeds
                following the modern method of constructing most field theories: by first postulating a set of
                symmetries of the system, and then by writing down the most general renormalizable Lagrangian from its
                particle (field) content that observes these symmetries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The global Poincaré symmetry is postulated for all relativistic quantum field theories. It consists of
                the familiar translational symmetry, rotational symmetry and the inertial reference frame invariance
                central to the theory of special relativity. The local <span>\( SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) \)</span>
                gauge symmetry is an internal symmetry that essentially defines the Standard Model. Roughly, the three
                factors of the gauge symmetry give rise to the three fundamental interactions. The fields fall into
                different representations of the various symmetry groups of the Standard Model (see table). Upon writing
                the most general Lagrangian, one finds that the dynamics depends on 19 parameters, whose numerical
                values are established by experiment.

            <h4>Quantum chromodynamics sector</h4>
            <p>
                The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sector defines the interactions between quarks and gluons, which is a
                Yang–Mills gauge theory with SU(3) symmetry, generated by Ta. Since leptons do not interact with gluons,
                they are not affected by this sector. The Dirac Lagrangian of the quarks coupled to the gluon fields is
                given by
            </p>
            <p class="mathjax">
                $$ \mathcal{L}_{QCD} = \sum_{\psi} \overline {\psi_i} \Big( i\gamma ^{\mu} \left( \partial _{\mu}
                \delta_{ij} - ig_{s} G_{\mu}^{a} T_{ij}^{a}\right) \Big) \psi_{j} - \frac{1}{4} G_{\mu \nu}^{a}
                G_{a}^{\mu \nu}$$
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>\( \psi_i \)</span> is the Dirac spinor of the quark field, where <span>\( i = {r, g, b} \)</span>
                represents color,<br />
                <span>\( \gamma^{\mu} \)</span> are the Dirac matrices,<br />
                <span>\( G_{\mu}^{a} \)</span> is the 8-component <span>\(

                <span>\(G_{\mu \nu}^{a} \)</span> represents the gluon field strength tensor,</br />
                <span>\(g_s\)</span> is the strong coupling constant.

            <h4>Electroweak sector</h4>
            <p>
                The electroweak sector is a Yang–Mills gauge theory with the symmetry group
                <span>\(U(1) \times SU(2)_L\)</span>,
            </p>
            <p class="mathjax">
                $$ \mathcal{L}_{EW} = \sum_{\psi}{\overline {\psi}} \gamma^{\mu}\Big( i \partial_{\mu} - g' \frac{1}{2}
                Y_W B_{\mu} - g \frac{1}{2} {\vec {\tau }}_L {\vec {W}}_{\mu} \Big) \psi - \frac{1}{4} W_a^{\mu \nu}
                W_{\mu \nu}^a - \frac{1}{4} B^{\mu \nu} B_{\mu \nu}$$
            </p>
            <p>where</p>
            <p>
                <span>\( B_{\mu} \)</span> is the <span>\( U(1) \)</span>
                gauge field,<br />
                <span>\(Y_W\)</span> is the weak hypercharge – the generator of the <span>\( U(1) \)</span>
                group,<br />
                <span>\( {\vec {W}}_{\mu} \)</span> is the 3-component <span>\( SU(2) \)</span> gauge field,<br />
                <span>\( {\vec {\tau }}_L \)</span> are the Pauli matrices - infinitesimal generators of the <span>\(
                    SU(2) \)</span> group – with subscript L to indicate that
                they only act on left-chiral fermions,<br />
                <span>\(g'\)</span> and <span>\(g\)</span> are the <span>\(U(1)\)</span> and <span>\(SU(2)\)</span>
                coupling constants respectively,<br />
                <span>\( W^{a\mu\nu} (a = 1,2,3)\)</span> and
                <span>\( B^{\mu \nu } \)</span> are the field strength tensors for the weak isospin and weak hypercharge
                fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice that the addition of fermion mass terms into the electroweak lagrangian is forbidden, since
                terms of the form <span>\( m \overline {\psi} \psi \)</span> do not respect <span>\( U(1) \times SU(2)_L
                    \)</span> gauge invariance. Neither is it possible to add explicit mass terms for the
                <span>\(U(1)\)</span> and <span>\(SU(2)\)</span> gauge fields. The Higgs mechanism is responsible for
                the generation of the gauge boson masses,
                and the fermion masses result from Yukawa-type interactions with the Higgs field.

            <h4>Higgs sector</h4>
            <p>
                In the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a complex scalar of the group <span>\(SU(2)_L\)</span>:
            </p>
            <p class="mathjax">
                $$ \varphi = \frac{1}{\sqrt {2}}
                \bigg( \begin{array}{c}
                \varphi ^{+}\\

            </p>
            <p>
                where the superscripts <span>\(+\)</span> and <span>\(0\)</span> indicate the electric charge
                (<span>\(Q\)</span>) of the components. The weak hypercharge (<span>\(YW\)</span>) of both components is
                <span>\(1\)</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before symmetry breaking, the Higgs Lagrangian is
            </p>
            <p class="mathjax">
                $$ \mathcal {L}_H = \varphi^{\dagger} \left( \partial^{\mu} - \frac{i}{2} \left( g'Y_W B^{\mu} + g
                \vec{\tau} \vec{W} ^{\mu} \right)\right)
                \left( \partial^{\mu} + \frac{i}{2} \left( g'Y_W B^{\mu} + g \vec{\tau} \vec{W} ^{\mu} \right)\right)
                \varphi - \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \left( \varphi^{\dagger} \varphi - v^2 \right)^2 $$
            </p>
            <p>which up to a divergence term, (i.e. after partial integration) can also be written as</p>
            <p class="mathjax">
                $$ \mathcal {L}_H = \left| \left( \partial^{\mu} + \frac{i}{2} \left( g'Y_W B^{\mu} + g \vec{\tau}
                \vec{W} ^{\mu} \right)\right)
                \varphi \right|^2 - \frac{\lambda^2}{4} \left( \varphi^{\dagger} \varphi - v^2 \right)^2 $$
            </p>
            <p>
                The Higgs self-coupling strength <span>\(λ\)</span> is approximately <span>\( \frac{1}{8} \)</span>.
                This is not included in the table above
                because it can be derived from the mass (after symmetry breaking) and the vacuum expectation
                value.
